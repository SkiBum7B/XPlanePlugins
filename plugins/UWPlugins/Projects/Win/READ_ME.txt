This solution contains projects which generate plugins for X-Plane.  These plugins can be uesd to control various parts of X-Plane.

These plugins are compatible with X-Plane 10.  If you would like the plugins to be compatible with X-Plane 9, you need to change the X-Plane SDK libraries to link against those found in the 'SDK' folder rather than the 'SDK213' folder.

You may encounter problems/errors when you build the entire solution all at once.  The workaround is to simply build each project individually.
